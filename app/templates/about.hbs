    <p>Repository Finder can help you find an appropriate repository to deposit your research data. 
      You can find repositories by searching by keywords or using the list of 
      repositories recommended by the Enabling FAIR Data Project or FAIRsFAIR Project.</p>

    <p>The <a href="http://www.copdess.org/enabling-fair-data-project/">Enabling FAIR Data Project</a> was led by the American Geophysical Union (AGU) 
    in partnership with DataCite and the earth and space sciences community. Enabling FAIR is supported by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation. </p>

    <p> The <a href="https://www.fairsfair.eu/">FAIRsFAIR</a> Project aims to provide a platform for using and implementing the FAIR principles in the day to day work of 
    European research data providers and repositories.</p>

    <p>The Repository Finder software is available as Open Source under an MIT license:</p>
