    <p>Repository Finder can help you find an appropriate repository to deposit your research data. 
      You can find repositories by searching by keywords or using the list of 
      repositories recommended by the Enabling FAIR Data Project.</p>

    <p>Repository Finder is a pilot project of the <a href="http://www.copdess.org/enabling-fair-data-project/">Enabling FAIR Data initiative</a> led by the American Geophysical Union (AGU) 
    in partnership with DataCite and the earth and space sciences community. Enabling FAIR is supported by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation. 
    The tool is hosted by DataCite and queries the re3data registry of research data repositories.</p>
